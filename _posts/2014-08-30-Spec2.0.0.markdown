I am glad to announce a new major release for Spec <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>.

## Backward compatibility breaker

- ListModel menus: now the `ListModel` instances use an instance of `MenuModel` as argument instead of a Morphic object. An example is provided in `ListModel class>>#example`

## Changes

- Removes unrelated to Spec core packages (i.e. `Spec-Tools`)
- Adds `SpecTableLayout`, thanks @webwarrior-ws 
- Removes hardcoded colours, thanks @Uko 

In addition, some bug fixes and clean ups.

This version has been tested with Pharo 4.0 - build 167
