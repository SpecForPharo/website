Today, Spec is changing its license.

Until today, Spec was released under the MIT license.

But after a disagreement with the Pharo direction, and in order to keep control of Spec future
it has been decided to change Spec license.

Now Spec is released under a dual license:

- GPL v3 license when shipped as part of a programming language, its core libraries and frameworks, or its Integrated Development Environment. For more information about the lincense, see [LICENSE-GPL](https://github.com/spec-framework/spec/blob/master/LICENSE-GPL3)
- MIT license for other cases. For more information about the license, see [LICENSE-MIT](https://github.com/spec-framework/spec/blob/master/LICENSE-MIT)
